  <h2>Where I&apos;m coming from&hellip;</h2>

  <p>I like to think of myself as an urban technologist. I&apos;ve spent much of the last decade+ working in civic technology as a web developer and data engineer. I like Cyd Harrell's definition of civic technology from <span style="font-style: italic;">A Civic Technologist&apos;s Practice Guide</span>:</p>

  <blockquote>&ldquo;Working in <strong>civic technology</strong> means partnering with any of thousands of entities in the wide universe of <strong>civic institutions</strong>, all with the common <strong>goal of improving public life</strong>.&rdquo;</blockquote>

  <p>My professional civic tech journey started in 2011 when I was an inaugural <a href="https://www.codeforamerica.org/">Code for America</a> Fellow. Today I have a consulting firm, Poe Public, through which I've consulted with cities such as Cambridge, MA and New York, NY on technology to support their participatory budgeting processes. Additionally, I have served as co-founder and CTO of Stepwise, a company dedicated to leveraging open data to help people make smarter, more impactful investments in the built environment. I've also been a Digital Services Architect at the City of Philadelphia&apos;s Office of <a href="https://beta.phila.gov/departments/office-of-the-chief-administrative-officer/functions/office-of-open-data-and-digital-transformation/">Open Data and Digital Transformation</a>, and a software developer at <a href="http://openplans.org/">OpenPlans</a>, where I helped to build tools that encouraged city residents to get involved in planning for the future of their cities.</p>

  <p>The perspective of technology as a means for social empowerment guides my extracurricular development as well.</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>In 2017 I was awarded a Technology and Democracy fellowship at the Harvard Kennedy School.</li>
    <li>I volunteer with <a href="http://www.codedbykids.com/">Coded by Kids</a> as an instructor and a board member</li>
    <li>I'm a member of the planning committee for the biannual <a href="https://appropriatetech.net/">International Conference on Appropriate Technology</a></li>

  <h2>Why I&apos;m here&hellip;</h2>

  <!-- 2. Tell me what you hope to learn in this course, and in your studies
          overall. Add a paragraph element (or two) below. -->
  <p>I appreciate opportunities to share knowledge and experience that I've gained with others.</p>

  <p>Working with geospatial data appeals to me because (1) it&apos;s fun, and (2) so much of public life is understood spatially. The technology is interesting, but designing and building tech that helps people understand, use, and affect their environment gets me out of bed.</p>
